      <description>Tree-Based Methods Tree-based methods stratify or segment the predictor space into a number of simple regions. To make a prediction, we use the mean or the mode of the training observations in the region in which the observation to be predicted belongs. The set of splitting rules can be summarized via a tree, these methods are also known as decision tree methods. Bagging, random forests and boosting produce multiple trees and then combine them in a single model to make the prediction.</description>
