      <description>### Introduction : Hypothesis testing is a procedure that is used to determine that whether a made statistical statement (known as hypothesis) is a reasonable one and should not be rejected, or is unreasonable and should be rejected. Hypothesis testing setup is initialized by formulating a Null Hypothesis ($H_0$), which is the hypothesis associated with a contradiction to the theory that one would like to prove and Alternate Hypothesis ($H_A$), which is the hypothesis associated with the theory that one would like to prove.</description>
