      <description>### Tests for the Difference Between Two Means (Large-Sample) : The basic idea to conduct the hypothesis test for difference between two means is to find the distribution for the difference of two means and test whether it is equal to 0 or not. Here is an example.
Example: Suppose that a production manager for a manufacturer of industrial machinery is concerned that ball bearings produced in environments with low ambient temperatures may have smaller diameters than those produced under higher temperatures.</description>

      <description>Hypothesis Testing is a method by which we can test an assumption made for a population parameter. For example, the statement $\mu &gt; 10$ is an assumption or hypothesis about the population mean $\mu$. To check the validity of this hypothesis, we must conduct a hypothesis test. Hypothesis tests are closely related to confidence intervals. Prior to performing a hypothesis test, we need to formulate the null and alternate hypothesis.</description>

      <description>#### Continuous Random Variables : A continuous random variable is a random variable which can take infinitely many values. The probabilities associated with a continuous RV is defined by probability density function(PDF).
#### Probability Density Function (PDF) : As a continuous RV takes infinite values, the probability $P(X=x)$ for it can not be defined and takes a value of 0. Instead we define a probability density funaction, which intutively depicts probability per unit space, where space is defined by the range of the underlying random variable.</description>

      <title>Random Variables (Part 1: Discrete Random Variables)</title>

      <description>Random Variable is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon or experiment. In other words, a random variable assigns a numeric value to each outcome of a random experiment. For example, if we roll a fair die, the random variable $X$ describing the experiment will take the values $1,2,3,4,5,6$ (which are the possible outcomes of the experiment). There are two types of random variables: discrete and continuous.</description>

      <description>2.1 Means and averages Mean of a sample is a summary statistics that can be computed as (where n is the total number of samples): $$\mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i{x_i}$$ An average is one of many summary statistics that can be used to describe the typical value or the central tendency of a sample.
2.2 Variance As mean describes the central tendency of a sample, Variance is intended to describe the spread.</description>
