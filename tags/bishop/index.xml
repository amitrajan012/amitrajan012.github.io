      <description>1.6 Information Theory Some amount of information is recieved when we observe the value of a discrete random variable $x$. If a highly improbable event has occured, the amount of information received is higher. For an event which was certain to happen, no amount of information is received. Hence, the measure of information $h(x)$ will therefore depend on the probability distribution $p(x)$ and will be a monotnic function of $p(x)$. For two unrelated events $x$ and $y$, the information gain from observing both of them $h(x,y) = h(x) + h(y)$ is sum of the information gained from each of them separately.</description>

      <description>1.5 Decision Theory The idea behind decision theorey is to convert the model probabilities (mainly for classification problem) to a decision. Given an input vector $x$ with the corresponding output $t$, the joint probability distribution $p(x,t)$ will provide the complete summary of uncertainity associated with these variables. Determination of $p(x,t)$ from the training data is a difficult problem and hence in a practical setting, we are more intersted in taking decisions based on probable value of $t$ for a given $x$.</description>

      <description>1.3 Model Selection One of the commonly used technique for model selection is cross-validation. In a $S-fold$ cross-validation, training set is divided into $S$ equal subests where one of the subset is used for model vaidation and the remaining $S-1$ sets will be used for model training. This means that a total fraction of $\frac{S-1}{S}$ of dataset is used for model training. For a scarce dataset, it is common practice to set $S=N$, which is called as leave-one-out cross-validation technique.</description>

      <description>1.2 Probability Theory Consider two random variables $X,Y$ where $X$ can take any of the values $x_i$ where $i=1,2,&amp;hellip;,M$ and $Y$ can take the values $y_j$ where $j=1,2,&amp;hellip;,L$. In a total of $N$ trials, both $X,Y$ are sampled and the number of trials for which $X=x_i,Y=y_j$ is $n_{ij}$. The number of trials in which $X=x_i$ is $c_i$ and $Y=y_j$ is $r_j$ respectively. Then, the joint probability of $X$ taking the value $x_i$ and $Y$ taking the value $y_j$ is given as:</description>

      <description>Any pattren recognition or machine learning task can be primarily divided into two categories: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. In a supervised machine learning problem, we have the input and corresponding desired output. For any supervised learning problem, the aim of the pattern recognition algorithm is to come up with an algorithm or model which can predict the output given the input. Based on the output, the supervised learning problem can be divided into two categories: Classification (when we have a finite number of discrete output) and Regression (if the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables).</description>
