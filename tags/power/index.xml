      <description>### Tests for Variances of Normal Populations : Let $X_1, X_2, &amp;hellip;, X_n$ be a simple random sample from a normal population given as $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The sample variance $s^2$ is given as:
$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \overline{X})^2$$
Then the test statistic $\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}$ follows a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. The null hypothesis can take any of the form:
$$H_0: \sigma^2 \leq \sigma_0^2;\ \sigma^2 = \sigma_0^2;\ \sigma^2 \geq \sigma_0^2$$</description>

      <description>### Introduction : Hypothesis testing is a procedure that is used to determine that whether a made statistical statement (known as hypothesis) is a reasonable one and should not be rejected, or is unreasonable and should be rejected. Hypothesis testing setup is initialized by formulating a Null Hypothesis ($H_0$), which is the hypothesis associated with a contradiction to the theory that one would like to prove and Alternate Hypothesis ($H_A$), which is the hypothesis associated with the theory that one would like to prove.</description>

      <description>The process of Hypothesis Testing can be summarized by following three steps:   Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is a mode of the system based on the assumption that apparent effect was actually due to chance.
  p-value: The p-value is the probability of the apparent effect under the null hypothesis.
  Interpretation: Based on the p-value, we can conclude that whether the effect is statistically significant or not.</description>
