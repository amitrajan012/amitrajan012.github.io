      <description>The process of Hypothesis Testing can be summarized by following three steps:   Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is a mode of the system based on the assumption that apparent effect was actually due to chance.
  p-value: The p-value is the probability of the apparent effect under the null hypothesis.
  Interpretation: Based on the p-value, we can conclude that whether the effect is statistically significant or not.</description>
