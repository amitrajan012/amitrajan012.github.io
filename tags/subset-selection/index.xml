      <description>Linear Model Selection and Regularization Befor moving to non-linear models, there are certain other fitting procedures through which a plain linear model can be improved. These alternate fitting procedures can yield better prediction accuracy and model interpretability.
  Prediction Accuracy: Provided that the relationship between predictors and response is linear, the least square estimates will have low bias. If n &amp;raquo; p, this model will have low variance as well.</description>
