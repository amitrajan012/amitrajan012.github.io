      <description>8.3 Markov Random Fields A Markov random field, also known as a Markov network or an undirected graphical model has a set of nodes each of which corresponds to a variable or grpup of variables and the undirected links each of which connects a pair of nodes.
8.3.1 Conditional Independence Properties In a directed graph, d-separataion can be used to check the conditional independence property. By removing the directed links from the graph, the assymetry between parent and child nodes is removed and hence the logic of d-separation can&amp;rsquo;t be applied directly.</description>

      <description>Probabilistic models can also be analyzed using diagrammatic representations of probability distributions, called probabilistic graphical models. A graph comprises nodes (also called vertices) connected by links (also known as edges or arcs). Each node represents a random variable (or group of random variables), and the links express probabilistic relationships between these variables. Graph then captures the way in which the joint distribution over all of the random variables can be decomposed into a product of factors each depending only on a subset of the variables.</description>
