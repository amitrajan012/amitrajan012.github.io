      <description>#### The Normal Distribution : The normal distribution is a continuous distribution with any mean and a positive variance. The probability density function of a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ is given as:
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
The above normal distribution is denoted as $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ with mean and variance as:
$$\mu_X = \mu$$
$$\sigma_X^2 = \sigma^2$$
For a normal distribution, about 68% of the population is in the interval $\mu \pm \sigma$, 95% in $\mu \pm 2\sigma$ and 99.</description>

      <description>#### The Bernoulli Distribution : Bernoulli trial is an experiment that can result in two outcomes: success (with probability $p$) and failure (with probability $1-p$). A Bernoulli random variable $X$ can be represented as $X \sim Bernoulli(p)$. It&amp;rsquo;s mean $\mu_X$ and variance $\sigma_X^2$ can be computed as:
$$\mu_X = 0 \times (1-p) + 1 \times p = p$$
$$\sigma_X^2 = (0-p)^2(1-p) + (1-p)^2p = p(1-p)$$
 #### The Binomial Distribution : When a set of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials are conducted, each with a success probability of $p$, a random variable $X$ which is equal to the number of success in these trials is said to have the binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ and is represented as $X \sim Bin(n, p)$.</description>
