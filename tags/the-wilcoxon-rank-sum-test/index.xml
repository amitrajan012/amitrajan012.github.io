      <description>### Distribution-Free Tests : The one assumption for the Student&amp;rsquo;s t tests performed above was the fact that the samples should come from the normal distribution. In distribution-free tests, this restriction is relaxed, i.e. the samnples are not required to come from any specific distribution. Distribution-free tests are sometimes called as nonparametric tests. Mainly, there are two types of distribution-free tests: Wilcoxon signed-rank test(test for population mean) and Wilcoxon rank-sum test / Mann-Whitney test (analogous to the two-sample t test).</description>
