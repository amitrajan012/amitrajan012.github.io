      <description>1.3 Model Selection One of the commonly used technique for model selection is cross-validation. In a $S-fold$ cross-validation, training set is divided into $S$ equal subests where one of the subset is used for model vaidation and the remaining $S-1$ sets will be used for model training. This means that a total fraction of $\frac{S-1}{S}$ of dataset is used for model training. For a scarce dataset, it is common practice to set $S=N$, which is called as leave-one-out cross-validation technique.</description>
