      <description>3.2 Bias-Variance Decomposition We have seen that the use of maximum likelihood, or equivalently least squares, can lead to severe over-fitting if complex models are trained using data sets of limited size. However, limiting the number of basis functions in order to avoid over-fitting has the side effect of limiting the flexibility of the model to capture interesting and important trends in the data. The phenomenon of over-fitting is really an unfortunate property of maximum likelihood and does not arise when we marginalize over parameters in a Bayesian setting.</description>

      <description>3.1.2 Geometry of Least Squares The least square problem can be geometrically interpreted as follows. Let the target veactor $t$ (having output for $N$ data points) spans a $N$-dimensional space. Each basis vector $\phi_j(X_n)$ will also be present in the same space. If the number $M$ of basis functions is smaller than the number of data points $N$, then the $M$ basis vectors will span a subspace $S$ of dimensionality $M$.</description>

      <description>Linear regression model has the property of being linear functions of adjustable parameters. We can add more complexity in the linear regression models by taking linear combinations of a fixed set of nonlinear functions of the input variables, known as basis functions. In the modeling process, giveb $x$, we have to predict $t$ which can be predicted as $y(x)$. Form a probabilistic prespective, we aim to model the predictive distribution $p(t|x)$ as this expresses the uncertainty about the value of $t$ for each value of $x$.</description>
