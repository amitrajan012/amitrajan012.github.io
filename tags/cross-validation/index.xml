      <description>1.3 Model Selection One of the commonly used technique for model selection is cross-validation. In a $S-fold$ cross-validation, training set is divided into $S$ equal subests where one of the subset is used for model vaidation and the remaining $S-1$ sets will be used for model training. This means that a total fraction of $\frac{S-1}{S}$ of dataset is used for model training. For a scarce dataset, it is common practice to set $S=N$, which is called as leave-one-out cross-validation technique.</description>

      <description>The process of Hypothesis Testing can be summarized by following three steps:   Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is a mode of the system based on the assumption that apparent effect was actually due to chance.
  p-value: The p-value is the probability of the apparent effect under the null hypothesis.
  Interpretation: Based on the p-value, we can conclude that whether the effect is statistically significant or not.</description>

      <description>Resampling Methods Resampling methods involve repeatedly drawing samples from training data and refitting a model on them. Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive. Cross-validation and bootstrap are two of the most commonly used resampling methods. Cross-validation can be used to estimate the test error rate associated with a given model in order to evaluate its performance. The process of evaluating a model&amp;rsquo;s performance is called model assessment. The process of selecting proper level of flexibility for a model is known as model selection.</description>
