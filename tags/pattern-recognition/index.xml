      <description>2.5 Nonparametric Methods Till now to model the data, we have choosen distributions which are governed by some fixed small number of parameters. This is called as parametric approach to density modeling. The chosen density might be a poor model of the distribution that generates the data, which can result in poor predictive performance. In nonparametric approach, we make fewer assumptions about the form of distribution.
One common nonparametric approach is histogram density models.</description>

      <description>2.4 The Exponential Family Exponential family of distributions over $X$ with parameters $\eta$ is defined as
$$\begin{align} p(X|\eta) = h(X)g(\eta)exp[\eta^Tu(X)] \end{align}$$
Here $\eta$ is the natural parameter of the distribution and $u(X)$ is some function of $X$. $g(\eta)$ ensures that the distribution is normalized and satisfies
$$\begin{align} g(\eta) \int h(X)exp[\eta^Tu(X)] dX = 1 \end{align}$$
Bernoulli distribution is a common exponential distribution. It is given as
$$\begin{align} p(x|\mu) = Bern(x|\mu) = \mu^x(1-\mu)^{1-x} = exp[x\ln \mu + (1-x)\ln(1-\mu)] \end{align}$$</description>

      <description>2.3.8 Periodic Variables Periodic variables usually repeats its behaviour after a set amount of time. Let us assume a periodic variable represented as an angle from the x-axis by $D={\theta_1, \theta_2, &amp;hellip;, \theta_N}$, where $\theta$ is measured in radians. The mean and variance of these data points will depend on the choice of origin and the axis. To find the invariant measure of the mean, we denote these observations as the points on the unit circle and can be described as a two-dimensional unit vectors $X_1,X_2,&amp;hellip;,X_N$ where $||X_n|| = 1$ for $n=1,2,&amp;hellip;,N$ as shown in the following figure.</description>

      <description>2.3.6 Bayesian Inference for the Gaussian We can use Bayesian treatment to derive the point estimates for the mean and variance of the Gaussian by introducing prior distributions over these parameters. For a single ranodm variable, let us suppose that the variance $\sigma^2$ is known and we have to determine the mean $\mu$ given $N$ data points $X={x_1,x_2,&amp;hellip;,x_N}$. Under the assumption of independence, the likelihood function is give as
$$\begin{align} p(X|\mu) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} p(x_n|\mu) = \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{N/2}} exp \bigg(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{n=1}^{N}(x_n - \mu)^2\bigg) \end{align}$$</description>

      <description>2.3.3 Bayes&amp;rsquo; Theorem for Gaussian Variables The applicatio of Bayes&amp;rsquo; theorem in the Gaussian setting is when we have Gaussian marginal distribution $p(X)$ and a Gaussian conditional distribution $p(Y|X)$ and we wish to find the marginal and consitional distribution $p(Y)$ and $p(X|Y)$. It should be noted that the mean and covariace of the marginal distribution $p(X)$ are constant with respect to $X$. The covarince of the conditional distribution $p(Y|X)$ is constant with respect to $X$ but its mean is a linear function of $X$.</description>

      <description>2.3.1 Conditional Gaussian Distribution If two sets of variables are jointly Gaussian, then the conditional distribution of one set conditioned on the othre is Gaussian. The marginal distribution of either set is also Gaussian. Let $X$ is a $D$-dimensional vector with Gaussian distribution $N(X|\mu,\Sigma)$. $X$ is partitioned into two disjoint subsets $X_a,X_b$. Without loss of generality we can assume thet $X_a$ forms the first $M$ components of $X$ and $X_b$ the remaining $D-M$, such that</description>

      <description>2.3 The Gaussian Distribution Gaussian Distribution is a widely used model for the distribution of continous variables. For a single variable $x$, the gaussian distribution is given as
$$\begin{align} N(x|\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{1/2}} exp \bigg[\frac{-1}{2\sigma^2} (x-\mu)^2\bigg] \end{align}$$
where $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are mean and variance respectively. For a $D$ dimensional vector $X$, the multivariate gaussian distribution takes the form
$$\begin{align} N(X|\mu,\Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{D/2}}\frac{1}{|\Sigma|^{1/2}} exp \bigg[\frac{-1}{2} (X-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(X-\mu)\bigg] \end{align}$$
where $\mu$ is a $D$ dimensional mean vector and $\Sigma$ is a $D\times D$ dimensional covariance matrix with $|\Sigma|$ being its determinant.</description>

      <description>2.2 Multinomial Variables A multinomila variable can be in any of $K$ states instead of just $2$ (in case of a binary variable). For example, a multinomial variable having $K=5$ states can be represented as $x=(0,0,1,0,0)^T$ where it is in a state where $x_3=1$. This vector will satisfy $\sum_{k=1}^K = 1$. If we denote the probability of $x_k=1$ by $\mu_k$, the distribution of $x$ is given as:
$$\begin{align} p(x|\mu) = \prod_{k=1}^{K} \mu_k^{x_k} \end{align}$$</description>

      <description>One goal of pattern recognition is to model the probability distribution $p(x)$ of a random variable $x$ given the finite set of points $x_1, x_2, &amp;hellip;, x_N$. This problem is known as density estimation. For simplicity, we can assume that the points are independent and identically distributed. There can be infinitely many distributions that can give rise to the given data points with any distribution that is non-zero at the points $x_1, x_2, &amp;hellip;, x_N$ as a potential candidate.</description>

      <description>1.6 Information Theory Some amount of information is recieved when we observe the value of a discrete random variable $x$. If a highly improbable event has occured, the amount of information received is higher. For an event which was certain to happen, no amount of information is received. Hence, the measure of information $h(x)$ will therefore depend on the probability distribution $p(x)$ and will be a monotnic function of $p(x)$. For two unrelated events $x$ and $y$, the information gain from observing both of them $h(x,y) = h(x) + h(y)$ is sum of the information gained from each of them separately.</description>

      <description>1.5 Decision Theory The idea behind decision theorey is to convert the model probabilities (mainly for classification problem) to a decision. Given an input vector $x$ with the corresponding output $t$, the joint probability distribution $p(x,t)$ will provide the complete summary of uncertainity associated with these variables. Determination of $p(x,t)$ from the training data is a difficult problem and hence in a practical setting, we are more intersted in taking decisions based on probable value of $t$ for a given $x$.</description>

      <description>1.3 Model Selection One of the commonly used technique for model selection is cross-validation. In a $S-fold$ cross-validation, training set is divided into $S$ equal subests where one of the subset is used for model vaidation and the remaining $S-1$ sets will be used for model training. This means that a total fraction of $\frac{S-1}{S}$ of dataset is used for model training. For a scarce dataset, it is common practice to set $S=N$, which is called as leave-one-out cross-validation technique.</description>

      <description>1.2 Probability Theory Consider two random variables $X,Y$ where $X$ can take any of the values $x_i$ where $i=1,2,&amp;hellip;,M$ and $Y$ can take the values $y_j$ where $j=1,2,&amp;hellip;,L$. In a total of $N$ trials, both $X,Y$ are sampled and the number of trials for which $X=x_i,Y=y_j$ is $n_{ij}$. The number of trials in which $X=x_i$ is $c_i$ and $Y=y_j$ is $r_j$ respectively. Then, the joint probability of $X$ taking the value $x_i$ and $Y$ taking the value $y_j$ is given as:</description>

      <description>Any pattren recognition or machine learning task can be primarily divided into two categories: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. In a supervised machine learning problem, we have the input and corresponding desired output. For any supervised learning problem, the aim of the pattern recognition algorithm is to come up with an algorithm or model which can predict the output given the input. Based on the output, the supervised learning problem can be divided into two categories: Classification (when we have a finite number of discrete output) and Regression (if the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables).</description>
