      <description>3.3 Bayesian Linear Regression One of the problems with frequentist approach and using maximum likelihood estimator is the issue of deciding the appropriate model complexity for the particular problem, which cannot be decided simply by maximizing the likelihood function, because this always leads to excessively complex models and over-fitting. We therefore turn to a Bayesian treatment of linear regression, which will avoid the over-fitting problem of maximum likelihood, and which will also lead to automatic methods of determining model complexity using the training data alone.</description>
