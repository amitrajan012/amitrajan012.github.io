      <description>### Tests with Categorical Data : A generalization of the Bernoulli trial is the multinomial trial, which is an experiment that can rsult in any one of the $k$ outcomes where $k \geq 2$. Let the probabilities of the $k$ outcomes be denoted by $p_1, p_2, p_3, &amp;hellip;, p_k$ and the prespecified values be $p _{01}, p _{02}, &amp;hellip;, p _{0k}$. We need to conduct a test to chek whether the probabilities are equal to the prespecified values or not.</description>

      <description>The process of Hypothesis Testing can be summarized by following three steps:   Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is a mode of the system based on the assumption that apparent effect was actually due to chance.
  p-value: The p-value is the probability of the apparent effect under the null hypothesis.
  Interpretation: Based on the p-value, we can conclude that whether the effect is statistically significant or not.</description>
