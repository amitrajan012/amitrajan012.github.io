      <description>8.3 Markov Random Fields A Markov random field, also known as a Markov network or an undirected graphical model has a set of nodes each of which corresponds to a variable or grpup of variables and the undirected links each of which connects a pair of nodes.
8.3.1 Conditional Independence Properties In a directed graph, d-separataion can be used to check the conditional independence property. By removing the directed links from the graph, the assymetry between parent and child nodes is removed and hence the logic of d-separation can&amp;rsquo;t be applied directly.</description>
