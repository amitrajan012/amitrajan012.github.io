      <description>The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test is a distribution free test or non-parametric test which is used to test the population mean when the samples do not come from any specific distribution. The idea behind The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test is to median-center the samples and give signed-ranks to the individual values. If the sum of the negative ranks (S-) is larger, we can conclude that the population mean is lesser than the mentioned value.</description>

      <description>### Distribution-Free Tests : The one assumption for the Student&amp;rsquo;s t tests performed above was the fact that the samples should come from the normal distribution. In distribution-free tests, this restriction is relaxed, i.e. the samnples are not required to come from any specific distribution. Distribution-free tests are sometimes called as nonparametric tests. Mainly, there are two types of distribution-free tests: Wilcoxon signed-rank test(test for population mean) and Wilcoxon rank-sum test / Mann-Whitney test (analogous to the two-sample t test).</description>
