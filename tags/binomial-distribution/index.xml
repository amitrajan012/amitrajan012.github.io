      <description>The belief in which probability is expressed in terms of frequencies is called as frequentism. Frequentists believe that if there is no set of identical trials, there is no probability.
An alternative is Bayesianism, which defines probability as a degree of belief that an event will occur. By this definition, the notion of probability can be applied in almost any cicumstance. One drawback of Bayesian probability is that it depends on person&amp;rsquo;s state of knowledge.</description>
