      <description>#### Confidence Intervals for Proportions : Let $X$ be the number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$, where the number of trials $n$ is large enough, such that $X \sim Bin(n, p)$. Then the $100(1 - \alpha) %$ confidence interval for $p$ is:
$$\widehat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n}}$$
where $\widehat{p}$ is the sample proportion and can be estimated as $\frac{X}{n}$. It should be noted that the quantity under the square root is the sample variance.</description>

      <description>#### The Bernoulli Distribution : Bernoulli trial is an experiment that can result in two outcomes: success (with probability $p$) and failure (with probability $1-p$). A Bernoulli random variable $X$ can be represented as $X \sim Bernoulli(p)$. It&amp;rsquo;s mean $\mu_X$ and variance $\sigma_X^2$ can be computed as:
$$\mu_X = 0 \times (1-p) + 1 \times p = p$$
$$\sigma_X^2 = (0-p)^2(1-p) + (1-p)^2p = p(1-p)$$
 #### The Binomial Distribution : When a set of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials are conducted, each with a success probability of $p$, a random variable $X$ which is equal to the number of success in these trials is said to have the binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ and is represented as $X \sim Bin(n, p)$.</description>

      <description>The belief in which probability is expressed in terms of frequencies is called as frequentism. Frequentists believe that if there is no set of identical trials, there is no probability.
An alternative is Bayesianism, which defines probability as a degree of belief that an event will occur. By this definition, the notion of probability can be applied in almost any cicumstance. One drawback of Bayesian probability is that it depends on person&amp;rsquo;s state of knowledge.</description>
