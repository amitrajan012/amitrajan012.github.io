      <description>The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test is a distribution free test or non-parametric test which is used to test the population mean when the samples do not come from any specific distribution. The idea behind The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test is to median-center the samples and give signed-ranks to the individual values. If the sum of the negative ranks (S-) is larger, we can conclude that the population mean is lesser than the mentioned value.</description>

      <description>### Tests for Variances of Normal Populations : Let $X_1, X_2, &amp;hellip;, X_n$ be a simple random sample from a normal population given as $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The sample variance $s^2$ is given as:
$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \overline{X})^2$$
Then the test statistic $\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}$ follows a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. The null hypothesis can take any of the form:
$$H_0: \sigma^2 \leq \sigma_0^2;\ \sigma^2 = \sigma_0^2;\ \sigma^2 \geq \sigma_0^2$$</description>

      <description>### Tests with Categorical Data : A generalization of the Bernoulli trial is the multinomial trial, which is an experiment that can rsult in any one of the $k$ outcomes where $k \geq 2$. Let the probabilities of the $k$ outcomes be denoted by $p_1, p_2, p_3, &amp;hellip;, p_k$ and the prespecified values be $p _{01}, p _{02}, &amp;hellip;, p _{0k}$. We need to conduct a test to chek whether the probabilities are equal to the prespecified values or not.</description>

      <description>### Distribution-Free Tests : The one assumption for the Student&amp;rsquo;s t tests performed above was the fact that the samples should come from the normal distribution. In distribution-free tests, this restriction is relaxed, i.e. the samnples are not required to come from any specific distribution. Distribution-free tests are sometimes called as nonparametric tests. Mainly, there are two types of distribution-free tests: Wilcoxon signed-rank test(test for population mean) and Wilcoxon rank-sum test / Mann-Whitney test (analogous to the two-sample t test).</description>

      <description>### Tests for the Difference Between Two Means (Large-Sample) : The basic idea to conduct the hypothesis test for difference between two means is to find the distribution for the difference of two means and test whether it is equal to 0 or not. Here is an example.
Example: Suppose that a production manager for a manufacturer of industrial machinery is concerned that ball bearings produced in environments with low ambient temperatures may have smaller diameters than those produced under higher temperatures.</description>

      <description>### Tests for a Population Proportion : The hypothesis testing for population proportion can be conducted in a similar manner. Here are some examples to depict it.
Example: A supplier of semiconductor wafers claims that of all the wafers he supplies, no more than 10% are defective. A sample of 400 wafers is tested, and 50 of them, or 12.5%, are defective. Can we conclude that the claim is false?</description>

      <description>Hypothesis Testing is a method by which we can test an assumption made for a population parameter. For example, the statement $\mu  10$ is an assumption or hypothesis about the population mean $\mu$. To check the validity of this hypothesis, we must conduct a hypothesis test. Hypothesis tests are closely related to confidence intervals. Prior to performing a hypothesis test, we need to formulate the null and alternate hypothesis.</description>

      <description>### Introduction : Hypothesis testing is a procedure that is used to determine that whether a made statistical statement (known as hypothesis) is a reasonable one and should not be rejected, or is unreasonable and should be rejected. Hypothesis testing setup is initialized by formulating a Null Hypothesis ($H_0$), which is the hypothesis associated with a contradiction to the theory that one would like to prove and Alternate Hypothesis ($H_A$), which is the hypothesis associated with the theory that one would like to prove.</description>

      <description>The process of Hypothesis Testing can be summarized by following three steps:   Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is a mode of the system based on the assumption that apparent effect was actually due to chance.
  p-value: The p-value is the probability of the apparent effect under the null hypothesis.
  Interpretation: Based on the p-value, we can conclude that whether the effect is statistically significant or not.</description>
